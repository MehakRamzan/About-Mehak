    <h2>Passionate Full Stack Developer in Progress</h2>
    <p>
      I started my journey in 2021 as a graphic designer while I was a high
      school student. Later, I explored the basics of UI/UX design. My
      curiosity about how websites operate live pushed me to learn web
      development, starting with WordPress in 2022. In 2023, I began learning
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but managing studies and learning without
      mentorship made progress challenging. In 2024, I ventured into
      full-stack development using MERN technologies, completed small projects
      like a blog app and a to-do app, but still seek to refine my skills
      further. I am an experienced WordPress developer collaborating with
      companies and clients, but my ultimate goal is to become a skilled
      full-stack developer before 2026.
